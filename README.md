Don't rely on this too much yet but currently it will install Alfresco 4.2.f with a Mysql database on either debian or redhat type systems (tested with Ubuntu 14.04 and CentOS 6)

current limitations:

	Username and password are not configurable (currently 'admin')

	mysql root passwd is not set

	Search is lucene not solr

	Libre Office is not installed

	Swftools is not installed
